# Flight-Delay-Prediction
Suppose I am a consultant at any company, assigned with the task of analysing flight delays for the airport authorities, to assist them in revamping their operations. Predicting flight delays can be useful to a variety of organizations: airport authorities, airlines, aviation authorities. At times, joint task forces have been formed to address the problem. Such an organization, if it were to provide ongoing real-time assistance with flight delays, would benefit from some advance notice about flights likely to be delayed.
The outcome of interest is whether the flight is delayed or not (delayed means more than 15 minutes late). Our data consist of all flights from the Washington, DC area into the New York City area during January 2004. The percent of delayed flights among these 2201 flights is 19.5%. The data were obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website (www.transtats.bts.gov).
You decide to interpret the problem as a Machine Learning problem and define the goal as to predict accurately whether a new flight, not in this dataset, will be delayed or not. The outcome variable is a variable called Flight Status, coded as delayed or on time
